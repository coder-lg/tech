# What are Chromebooks?
Cheap but powerful computers with Android+Linux support.
### About Chromebooks

Let's get one thing straight here. You want a high-end programming PC like a MacBook Air. But it is almost more than $500, and it might be a waste. You use Android/iOS and have a Windows PC with `Your Phone` app connected to your Android/iOS. But, trust me, it happens all the time, it just disconnects when you are out of range, like, you have a BIG house, you kept the phone at living room, and went to code on your Windows PC. Suddenly, your friend SMS'd you. You try to view it on your PC and, bam! Not connected. Makes me :angry: ALL THE TIME. But, Chromebooks? They are different. Example is: You need MongoDB on your Windows PC. You want it on your WSL, but no. You can't get it on your Debian WSL for code-server. 

Well, Chromebooks are different, as they say. Try to combine a Mac's terminal with Windows's not-so-simple compatibility, add some Linux kernel built-in, waiting to get enabled, and add a tinge of Android support. The result of this mixure?

Chrome OS.

They are just a special mix of Android and Windows that is on low-end PCs, running Intel Celeron/Tiger Lake chips. Or even Mediatek chips.

But, hear **THIS**, they are **CHEAP**. Cheap like heck. My favourite Chromebook of all time, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet(not bought yet but cool) has 256 GB, same they offer in the MacBook Air's base model, but it is for $300 or less.

What the? Have I been fooled by Apple? 

No.

They use premium things.

Hit me.

But the  Duet? It's cheap and cool.

I mean, it has 6 GB of RAM and has 256 GB of storage, but it doesn't end there. It is like a Surface, detachable AND never disconnects from your phone(Google Connection) and you can get Debian in that for free. It has Google Play support, which means...
```
Bye, bye, Bluestacks!
```
You can get Steam if you have Debian on it. Even VS Code is available for Chromebooks.

Let's just call Debian on Chrome OS as Crostini, okay?

You can get GIMP, Kdenlive, VS Code, SSH, Postman, GitHub Desktop, Git, Node JS and more via Crostini. And, it supports terminal tabs. Windows' CMD has one window, but Windows Terminal has tabs. Similarly, Crostini got tabs. So you can get an app downloaded while using Vim or Emacs, or run a server while using Weechat.

And MORE.

USI stylus support on all touchscreen chromebooks.

Every mid range chromebooks are between $200-$300 and, therefore, I end this section here.

### The beginning of Android+Linux on Chrome OS
Google made Chrome OS to fight Windows and till 2017, it was just crap. Needed internet to run, no Linux, no Android. But, in 2017, Google added Android App support to Chrome OS. Till then, it was just Chrome Apps. Now, there is changes. At least, something's improving. But, they added Crostini by 2018/2019.
Some more improvements. But, in 2020, the surge happened.

I mean, in 2019, Chromebooks were mediocre. No big sales. But, in 2020, since online schooling appeared, Chromebook sales surged. Every parent wanted a Chromebook for their kids. So, Chromebooks gained fame. For being cheap but, still, fast, with Linux for the devs, Zoom and Google Meet for the kids, and it was helpful. Now, the people has realised the Chromebooks were worth it.

Google soon introduced the Phone Hub, a copy of the Your Phone of Windows, and you can connect it FOREVER, with your Android. So, now, you got Smart Lock, easy to unlock by bringing your phone to your Chromebook when you want to unlock it without your password, similar to MacOS's unlocking(idk the name) with your Apple Watch.

Then, they added a shortcut to the Phone Hub on the shelf(that's what they call the taskbar/dock) which help you to access your phone's hotspot(charges apply) with silent and some other button with a small section for seeing your phone's battery. There is the Launcher, like Windows' Start and MacOS' Launchpad where you can see your apps and that include Linux too.

Let's end here for now, can't write a big essay but ending it here.

See ya later!
